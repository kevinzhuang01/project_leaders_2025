biography: Kathryn Maupin is a Principal Member of the Technical Staff at Sandia National
  Laboratories. Motivated by a passion for transforming uncertainty into actionable
  insights, Kathryn leverages her extensive expertise in model validation, model form
  error quantification, and Bayesian analyses to drive innovative solutions that enhance
  research outcomes. Kathryn earned her PhD in Computational Science, Engineering,
  and Mathematics, along with her M.S. in Computational and Applied Mathematics, both
  from The University of Texas at Austin. Her fascination with mathematical modeling
  began at the University of California, San Diego, where she completed her B.A. in
  Applied Mathematics. When she is not immersed in data and algorithms, Kathryn enjoys
  the chaos of family life with her three children and three dogs. Looking ahead,
  Kathryn aspires to continue pushing the boundaries of computational science while
  encouraging others to confront ubiquitous uncertainty in their work.

abstract: As the third pillar of science, computational simulation has allowed scientists
  to explore, observe, and test physical regimes previously thought to be unattainable.
  High-fidelity models are derived from physical principles and calibrated to experimental
  data. However, missing or unknown physics and measurement, experimental, and numerical
  errors give rise to uncertainties in the model form and parameter values in even
  the most trustworthy models. Thus, rigorous calibration and validation of a computational
  model is paramount to its effective us as a predictive tool. The popularity of the
  Bayesian paradigm stems from its natural integration of measurement and model uncertainties.
  A systematic approach to model validation, progressing from parameter and quantity
  of interest identification to sensitivity analysis, calibration, and validation,
  is applied to a drift-diffusion simulation code called Charon. Charon allows the
  computational qualification of semiconductor devices subjected to displacement damage.
