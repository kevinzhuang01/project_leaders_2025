  conducted research on ORB-SLAM3, focusing on developing and evaluating spatial masking
  techniques to improve pose estimation accuracy and performance. In computational
  biology, I work extensively in bioinformatics, particularly on projects involving
  molecular glues and protein folding. This includes designing and analyzing pipelines
  for degron prediction, integrating sequence, structural, and functional data to
  support drug discovery and protein function studies.
