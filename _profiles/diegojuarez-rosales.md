abstract: To reduce human error in creating input files for simulations, especially
  when handling hundreds or even thousands of jobs, we developed a robust and versatile
  Python framework to streamline the generation and analysis of large-scale simulation
  datasets for various executables. This framework automates the creation, submission,
  and execution of simulations, significantly reducing the time spent on preparing,
  copying, and submitting input files, executables, and additional parameters (such
  as potentials). This approach has greatly improved the efficiency and accuracy of
  simulations, especially on Perlmutter, a NERSC supercomputer, though it is adaptable
  for use on other systems as well can be adapted to another computing. This framework
  was deployed on Perlmutter, a supercomputer delivered to the National Energy Research
  Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), with successful results and is adaptable to
  other computing platforms.
academic_interests: Over the past two years, my research has centered on computational
  physics, with a particular focus on developing tools and codes to address physics
  problems. I am especially interested in applying these approaches to materials science,
  such as determining the mechanical and thermal properties of novel materials. To
  tackle these challenges, I rely on numerical methods and machine learning, as well
  as simulation techniques like molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory
  (DFT) for property extraction. I prefer not to treat scientific software as a “black
  box.” Instead, I actively study the documentation and underlying implementations,
  which has led me to learn coding languages such as C++ and Fortran, the same languages
  in which much of this software is developed. This deeper understanding allows me
  to customize and extend existing tools for my research.
