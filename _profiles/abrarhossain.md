project_title: Bandwidth Allocation for Heterogeneous HPC Data Ingestion using Dynamic
  Auctions
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: 'Modern High-Performance Computing (HPC) centers face significant challenges
  in ingesting large and diverse data streams, resulting in bandwidth bottlenecks
  and scientific delays. To overcome the limitations of traditional static allocation
  and simple queuing methods, this work introduces a dynamic, value-based approach
  to bandwidth allocation. We propose two new auction-based mechanisms: the computationally
  efficient Greedy Value Density Auction and the theoretically robust Vickrey-Clarke-Groves
  (VCG) Knapsack Auction. Both mechanisms utilize user-provided bids that specify
  data requirements and scientific value, aiming to maximize the total value of successful
  data transfers. Simulation results, based on realistic workload characteristics,
  show that these auction mechanisms significantly outperform standard First-Come,
  First-Served (FCFS) baselines. In high-load scenarios, our methods reduce average
  and tail completion delays by over 80% and improve predictability by decreasing
  the coefficient of variation of delay by up to 85%. Additionally, network stability
  is enhanced, with the peak-to-average load ratio reduced by as much as 70%. This
  value-driven, adaptive strategy alleviates congestion, improves bandwidth utilization,
  and ensures that access is prioritized based on scientific importance—ultimately
  accelerating scientific discovery.'
academic_interests: My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of
  High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems software and machine learning, with a focus
  on creating solutions that enhance the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability
  of scientific computing. I am particularly interested in resource management and
  automation. My work involves developing intelligent, power-aware job schedulers
  like TARDIS, which uses Graph Neural Networks to reduce energy costs, and automated
  performance tuning frameworks like LASP, which applies multi-armed bandit algorithms
  to optimize applications on resource-constrained edge devices. These projects aim
  to make complex computational systems more autonomous and cost-effective. This focus
  extends to the unique challenges of edge computing for scientific applications.
  My internship at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) involved designing
  private LoRa networks and implementing edge-ML models for real-time environmental
  data processing, demonstrating how HPC principles can be adapted to support distributed,
  data-intensive research. More recently, my interests have expanded to include HPC
  networking and data management. I am investigating congestion control in modern
  interconnects and developing novel, auction-based mechanisms for dynamic bandwidth
  allocation. My work at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)
  on network monitoring further reflects this interest in ensuring the underlying
  cyberinfrastructure is robust and observable.
