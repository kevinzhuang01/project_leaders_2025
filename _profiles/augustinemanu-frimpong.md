project_title: Adaptive Trend Extraction in Financial Time Series Using ℓ₁ Trend Filtering
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: Extracting underlying trends from noisy time series is a fundamental challenge
  in fields such as economics, finance, and environmental science. Traditional methods
  such as the Hodrick Prescott (HP) filter apply an ℓ₂ penalty that smooths curvature
  but often oversmooths abrupt changes, limiting their usefulness in detecting structural
  breaks. Building on the theoretical foundation of Kim, Koh, Boyd, and Gorinevsky
  (2009), this project applies ℓ₁ trend filtering which replaces the ℓ₂ penalty with
  an ℓ₁ penalty on second order differences to real financial data. The ℓ₁ approach
  produces piecewise linear trend estimates where slope changes correspond to structural
  events and it achieves computational complexity comparable to HP filtering. Using
  daily log transformed S and P 500 index data from early 2025, we implemented gradient
  descent optimization and compared both filters. The ℓ₁ filter more effectively identified
  sudden drops and recoveries, while residual analysis confirmed improved noise removal
  without oversmoothing. These results demonstrate ℓ₁ trend filtering as a practical
  and scalable alternative for uncovering meaningful regime shifts in financial and
  other time series.
academic_interests: I am interested in the point where software engineering, mathematics,
  and machine learning come together to solve real-world problems. What excites me
  most is working on systems that are not only theoretical but also usable and reliable.
  I enjoy thinking about how algorithms and models can be turned into tools that help
  researchers, students, and practitioners in different fields. Last summer I worked
  in an NSF REU where I studied ℓ₁ trend filtering for financial time series. I compared
  it with the Hodrick Prescott filter and learned how different mathematical models
  behave when faced with sudden changes in market data. That project gave me a strong
  appreciation for both optimization and statistical modeling, and how these methods
  can uncover hidden structure in complex signals. At the same time, I like building
  infrastructure-level software. For example, I developed a distributed market data
  microservice that streamed millions of datapoints with reliability, and I am also
  working on an offline AI tutor designed for students in low-connectivity regions.
  These projects remind me that research software engineering is about more than writing
  code — it is about creating systems that are scalable, reproducible, and useful
  to a community. Going forward, I want to continue studying high-performance computing,
  research software practices, and applied mathematics while contributing to open
  communities. My goal is to grow as a researcher who not only builds models but also
  ships software that makes research more accessible and impactful.
