biography: Khaled Ibrahim is a member of the Parallel Performance and AI Nexus (PPAN)
  group in the Computing Sciences Area. He is working on various research projects
  on high performance computing focusing on runtime systems, programming models, performance
  modeling and optimization, and computer architectures. Khaled Ibrahim came to Berkeley
  Lab in 2009, after working in INRIA, France. He obtained his PhD in computer engineering
  from North Carolina State University.
project_title: Performant Scientific Workflows in HPC Environments
topical_areas: Applied Computer Science; Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems;
  Computer Science; High Performance Computing; Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking
abstract: 'Modern scientific workflows are rapidly evolving, integrating LLMs, AI,
  and simulation codes to control, predict, and model complex discovery processes.
  Managing these intricate workflows effectively is crucial for leveraging HPC resources,
  preventing underutilization, and accelerating scientific progress. This project
  addresses these challenges through two main approaches: 1- Workload Instrumentation
  to Profile and Model Performance: By instrumenting workflow components, we gather
  detailed performance metrics to identify bottlenecks, understand resource consumption,
  and predict performance under various loads, enabling proactive optimization. 2-
  Orchestration of Resource Scheduling to Improve User Experience: Building on performance
  insights, we develop sophisticated scheduling mechanisms to dynamically allocate
  HPC resources, minimizing wait times, maximizing throughput, and enhancing user
  experience for scientists by accelerating experiment execution and model iteration.'
