abstract: 'This project investigates how researchers across scientific disciplines
  are reusing modern AI technologies—including pre-trained models (PTMs) and intelligent
  agents—in their research workflows. Although deep learning and related AI methods
  have transformed computational practice, training large models or building advanced
  agents remains costly and technically complex. As a result, many research communities
  increasingly rely on existing models and agent frameworks, yet we know relatively
  little about how this reuse is occurring outside computer science. Our study combines
  manual analysis with large-scale automated methods to develop a clearer understanding
  of AI reuse in practice. We are examining open-access scientific articles, datasets,
  and software projects to determine when AI technologies are reused, which types
  are most prevalent, and how researchers adapt or repurpose them for domain-specific
  tasks. Processing and analysis will be performed on advanced high-performance computing
  resources at Argonne National Laboratory to support large-scale document and data
  processing. We also classify reuse strategies using established software engineering
  taxonomies and analyze the relationship between reuse and scientific impact. Students
  joining the project will participate in empirical analysis, automated document processing,
  and user-study components to understand how scientists adopt, adapt, and evaluate
  emerging AI tools in their work.'
desired_skills: We welcome students with solid Linux and Python skills. Above all
  else, we value problem solving skills, effective communication and collaboration
  skills. We will consider students from any major, especially those in science and
  engineering programs that emphasize learning at least a little bit of computer science!
