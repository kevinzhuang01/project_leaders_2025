project_title: Accelerating GNN Inference for High-Speed Particle Track Reconstruction
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) process large, sparse, and irregular graphs,
  making them useful for particle track reconstruction. This project uses GNNs with
  TrackML which is a particle tracking challenge with the goal of reconstructing the
  paths of particles that traveled through detectors, and doing so as fast as possible
  without sacrificing accuracy. The GNN input graphs are processed using float32,
  but it is possible to also use Automated Mixed Precision (AMP) or manually convert
  to different precisions.
academic_interests: My current research interests involve GNNs, particularly how to
  lower the memory usage and time allocation for their inference. I've been participating
  in this research for a couple of months now and the possibilities that I have yet
  to research are very exciting.

## Academic Interests

My current research interests involve GNNs, particularly how to lower the memory usage and time allocation for their inference. I've been participating in this research for a couple of months now and the possibilities that I have yet to research are very exciting.
