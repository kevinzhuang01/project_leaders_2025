name: Johannes Blaschke
organization: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
title: Workflow enablement on HPC
field: Computing
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management
  &amp; storage systems, visualization); High-Performance Computing
status: Pre-Match+Workshop
abstract: 'This project explores various workflow technologies, and how they might
  be used on a Supercomputer at NERSC. Future Supercomputers will offer a broad range
  of capabilities at NERSC Examples relevant to scientific workflows on the include:
  simulation performance, data movement and management, application of machine learning,
  organization and composition of complex computational tasks, interaction with external
  resources beyond the NERSC data center (e.g. edge, cloud, and cross-facility). We
  will be working on developing benchmarks and test cases for a range of workflow
  technologies, depending on the applicant''s field of study and personal interest.
  Some example focus areas are: 1. Exploring use cases for workflow managers, eg:
  Fireworks, Snakemake, Parsl, etc 2. Exploring non-MPI communication libraries, eg.
  Distributed.jl, Legion, etc 3. Exploring new storage technologies and tools'
desired: 'Experience with: 1. Linux / Git 2. Compiling software (with Make and CMake)
  and managing shell environments 3. Some basic programming skills in C, Rust, Julia,
  and/or Python are a must. Depending on the focus area, applicants should have a
  strong interest in scientific software workflows for HPC systems.'
