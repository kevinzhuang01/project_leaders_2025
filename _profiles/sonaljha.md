project_title: Early Risk Assessment of Healthcare Conditions under Rural Data-Quality
  Constraints
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: Early risk assessment of healthcare conditions becomes particularly challenging
  in rural and resource-limited settings, where access to dense, continuous, and high-frequency
  medical data is constrained. Similar challenges arise in crisis scenarios, such
  as natural disasters, where robust monitoring infrastructure is unavailable. Despite
  these limitations, timely and real-time alerts are critical for enabling proactive
  clinical interventions. To address this gap, we explore graph-based algorithms that
  effectively leverage sparse, irregularly recorded, and low-frequency data to provide
  reliable early risk assessment under rural data-quality constraints.
academic_interests: I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech,
  where my research focuses on developing scalable graph-based anomaly detection algorithms
  for early and explainable disease detection in human and animal healthcare. This
  work lies at the intersection of graph analytics, machine learning, and high-performance
  computing (HPC), with a focus on methods that are both scientifically accurate and
  computationally efficient. Equally central to my academic path is my role as a Graduate
  Research Assistant with Virginia Tech’s Advanced Research Computing (ARC). In this
  position, I support university faculty, postdocs, and students in scaling and optimizing
  their workloads on ARC’s HPC clusters. My work spans research consultation, data
  management, and technical support, including designing and debugging SLURM job scripts,
  tuning performance for parallel codes, managing large-scale data pipelines, and
  installing scientific software. Increasingly, I have also helped users integrate
  AI workflows within HPC environments. A consistent theme has been lowering technical
  barriers by building user-friendly workflows so that researchers can more effectively
  leverage HPC resources without being slowed by system complexities. I further expanded
  these skills during my internship at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where I integrated
  data-driven sampling into in-situ cosmological simulations to reduce I/O bottlenecks,
  and at Uniform-Agri, where I developed scalable disease detection algorithms for
  animal health. Collectively, my research and professional experiences reflect a
  dual focus of advancing accurate and scalable methods for early disease detection
  and strengthening research software engineering practices that improve usability,
  accessibility, and impact of advanced computing across disciplines.
