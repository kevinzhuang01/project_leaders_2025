biography: Arianna Formenti is a post-doc in the Accelerator Technology and Applied
  Physics Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Her research interests
  include modeling of future particle colliders – such as Higgs factories and 10 TeV-level
  wakefield colliders – and fusions plasmas with advanced simulations. She is a maintainer
  of the code WarpX, which is part of the BLAST simulation toolkit. She received a
  BSc and MSC in Mathematical Engineering and a PhD in Energy and Nuclear Science
  and Technology from Politecnico di Milano, Italy. Arianna is also committed to science
  education, workforce development, and outreach.

abstract: 'This research project will be hosted by the Accelerator Modeling Program
  group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. AMP is a program within the Accelerator
  Technology and Applied Physics Division at Berkeley Lab that focuses on HPC to model
  particle accelerators, laser-plasma interactions, beam physics and plasma devices,
  and nuclear fusion. With this project, you will have the opportunity to contribute
  to ongoing research and gain hands-on experience in the field of computational physics
  within an open and team-science driven environment. Specifically, you will contribute
  to the development of the Beam, Plasma & Accelerator Simulation Toolkit by working
  in the WarpX team, an open-source massively-parallel particle-in-cell code that
  was awarded the prestigious 2022 ACM Gordon Bell Prize. You will participate in
  the advancement of theoretical and computational plasma and beam accelerator physics,
  through one or more of the various activities that occur in the program, which offers
  a wide range of possibilities such as: Investigating physics through simulation
  campaigns to support theoretical and/or experimental studies with the codes developed
  in the program; Improving our computational tools or methods for better performances
  on supercomputers, or for simulating new physics; Exploring novel numerical schemes,
  algorithms, and AI/ML approaches to improve simulations’ reliability.'
desired_skills: "* Python and/or C++ development * improve GPU-accelerated HPC open
  source codes * AI/ML * supercomputers such as Perlmutter (NERSC) * Python notebooks
  & presentations for demonstration/training/debugging. A background/study in physics,
  computer science or applied math is desired and the focus of the project will be
  adjusted accordingly. To stand out from the crowd, you might already have experience
  with Python and C++, know how to use GitHub, or have run simulations before."
