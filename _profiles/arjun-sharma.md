biography: Arjun Sharma is a Postdoctoral Appointee at Sandia National Laboratories
  (Computer Science Research Institute). He works at the intersection of fluid mechanics,
  computing, and machine learning, building fast, trustworthy models for design and
  discovery. Recent projects include improving classic wing aerodynamics with learned
  corrections, non local transport of nutrients in bacterial suspension, air-sea flux
  exchange in the DOE’s climate model, and machine learning physics parametrization
  for climate models. He codes in Python (JAX/PyTorch), Matlab and Fortran, uses GPUs,
  and runs larger studies on HPC clusters, with an emphasis on clear, reproducible
  workflows and understanding physical mechanisms. Arjun earned a Ph.D. in Mechanical
  Engineering (Applied Mathematics minor) from Cornell University. Before graduate
  school he worked in high-performance engineering at Rolls-Royce (aeroacoustics)
  and in Formula One (aerodynamics). He has taught and TA’d core courses in thermodynamics
  and fluid dynamics and enjoys mentoring students at different levels. For SRP, Arjun
  offers flexible projects where students can lean into coding, physics, or visualization
  and leave with a portfolio-ready artifact (well-documented repo, figures, and a
  short write-up). His mentoring style is supportive and structured, weekly one-on-ones,
  code reviews, and clear milestones, with opportunities for co-authorship when results
  warrant

abstract: 'Propellers and turbines, spinning blades on drones, aircraft, ships, and
  wind turbines, have been modeled since before powerful computers. Engineers built
  quick “low-order” tools such as blade-element models (slice each blade into small
  segments), actuator-line models (represent the blade as a line of force), and vortex
  methods (capture swirling wakes). These tools are fast and great for early design
  exploration but can miss important flow features. By contrast, high-fidelity computational
  fluid dynamics (CFD) resolves those details but is often too slow for everyday use.
  This project blends the best of both worlds. We keep the fast physics model and
  train a neural network to learn the missing piece, the difference between low-order
  predictions and high-fidelity results. This “grey-box” approach respects physics
  while data improves it. We focus on practical performance measures, how much push
  (thrust) and how hard to spin (torque), rather than every pressure or velocity detail,
  keeping the method simple for early design. Summer work may include building a benchmark
  dataset, designing and training neural network, visualizing results, and packaging
  a reusable tool. Students can focus on coding, physics, or visualization based on
  interest. The outcome: better early designs for aircraft, ships, and clean-energy
  systems.'
