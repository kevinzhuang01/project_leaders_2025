organization: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
title: Tokamak modeling
field: Numerical modeling
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.)
status: Pre-Match+Workshop
abstract: When finally harnessed, nuclear fusion holds the promise of almost limitless
  energy. We are partners in a project to better understand turbulence in tokamaks,
  a form of fusion reactor by improving existing models. Project ideas include improving
  numerics and performance of the model, adding additional physics to the model, and
  simulation-based projects to understand specific scenarios.
desired: 'Specific background depends on the specific project focus, but generally:
  applied mathematics, software development (C++, python), physics, climate science,
  etc.'
