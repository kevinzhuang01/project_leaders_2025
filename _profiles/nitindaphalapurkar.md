abstract: Mesoscale simulations implementing inelastic deformation of granular matter
  for accurate predictions of a moving shock. Unlike solids and fluids, the dynamic
  response of granular materials has the additional complexity of being dominated
  by the presence of irregular spaces between the grains. Under dynamic deformation,
  a grain squashes from impact, crushes, and squeezes through available pore spaces.
  The statistical nature of the complex shock response arising from tens of thousands
  of grains may result in a different compaction state than what was intended during
  its performance. The solution to this problem is at the intersection of geoscience
  and computational solid mechanics, which strives to develop a physically based,
  mesoscale-consistent continuum description for granular materials.
desired: Numerical simulations using solid mechanics methods, e.g. Finite element
  methods; discrete element methods, material point method. Multiscale coupling of
  physics, e.g. definition of stress tensor, temperature and other such variables;
  Machine Learning approach for predicting granular materials under pressure and shear
  loading.
