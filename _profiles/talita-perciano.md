abstract: This project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical quantum advantages
  and practical scientific applications by developing quantum algorithms and quantum
  machine learning methods, focusing on efficient data encoding to achieve quantum
  utility across diverse scientific domains. Our proposal centers on developing a
  sophisticated suite of quantum algorithms tailored to harness classical data for
  advanced scientific applications. We emphasize efficient quantum data encoding,
  coupled with error mitigation approaches, as a pivotal strategy to bridge the gap
  between theoretical quantum capabilities and practical use across diverse scientific
  domains. Targeting classical data, which parallels the concept of classical channels
  in quantum physics, our approach involves specific data reduction techniques and
  sparsity to refine and simplify the data to serve as input to our quantum algorithms.
  This makes it more amenable to quantum processing, particularly focusing on computationally
  intensive components of larger data analysis pipelines. Our methods encompass both
  pure quantum and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.
