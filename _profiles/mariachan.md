abstract: We use a combination of AI/ML and computational modeling to understand and
  design energy materials. In particular, we work on (1) predicting materials properties
  using a combination of first principles calculations and ML; (2) seeing materials
  changes in the nanoscale through interpreting x-ray and electron microscopy data;
  (3) using computer vision and language models to create intelligent knowledge extraction
  software. These approaches are applied towards energy storage, photovoltaics, or
  catalysis.
desired: 'Proficiency in Python programming is required. Knowledge of some of the
  following is beneficial: batteries, solar cell, catalysis, solid state physics,
  first principles or atomistic simulations, machine learning/artificial intelligence,
  computer vision, language models.'
