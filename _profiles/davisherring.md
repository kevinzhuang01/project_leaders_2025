status: Accept
abstract: Task-based parallelism imposes constraints on units of computational work
  to allow them to be dynamically scheduled for optimum hardware utilization. More
  sophsticated models for launching tasks can relax certain of these constraints and
  afford applications more expressive power in writing their tasks. Furthermore, additional
  information provided by the application can be used to optimize the execution of
  tasks with unusual semantics (e.g., that need filesystem access). We plan to explore
  the space of task semantics, identify which generalizations can be efficiently supported
  in FleCSI, and extend it to provide those which are most valuable for practical
  applications.
desired: C++ programming parallel programming (in any or all of MPI, CUDA, Kokkos,
  OpenMP, or kernel threads) high-performance computing environments computational
  methods
