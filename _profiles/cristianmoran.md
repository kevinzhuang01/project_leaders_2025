project_title: 'X2Sim: Rapid digital twin creation from text and videos for natural
  hazard modeling'
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: 'Traditional methods for modeling natural hazards such as landslides, floods,
  and storm surges are computationally intensive and time-consuming, thus limiting
  their applicability in effective disaster preparedness and response in real-world
  scenarios. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework, through TACC’s
  HPC resources, for rapidly creating digital twins that significantly reduces the
  time, manual input, and computational resources needed for simulating the interaction
  between natural hazards and real-world 3D objects. Our X2Sim framework utilizes
  an agentic text-to-simulation Large Language Model (LLM) to generate digital twins,
  integrating two distinct 3D object generation methods: (i) A text-to-3D point cloud
  diffusion model that swiftly creates 3D point clouds from natural language descriptions,
  enabling rapid digital twin prototyping, and (ii) An efficient method for constructing
  high-fidelity point clouds from video input, allowing for more detailed digital
  twin representations of existing structures. These digital twins are integrated
  into a Graph Network-based Simulator (GNS) that models the dynamics of particle
  and fluid interactions, enabling the simulation of complex natural hazard scenarios.
  Our X2Sim system allows for adjusting simulation parameters, offering a robust tool
  for exploring various disaster scenarios and their impacts on the digital twins.
  While our digital twin framework may not match the accuracy of high-fidelity numerical
  methods, it significantly reduces computation time and complexity, making it viable
  for near-real-time applications. The X2Sim approach offers a valuable balance between
  speed and precision in digital twin creation and simulation, providing a streamlined,
  low-intervention workflow for researchers and practitioners in natural hazard modeling
  and disaster preparedness.'
academic_interests: My academic/research interests are a combination of artificial
  intelligence, computer vision, and high-performance computing. I’m interested in
  projects that push the limits of scalability within these fields, whether that means
  training models on large datasets, running simulations, or developing tools that
  help researchers solve real-world problems faster. In the past, I have had the opportunity
  to work on projects that used HPC systems to simulate natural hazards and to train
  deep learning models. Through these experiences, I have learned that I really enjoyed
  combining technical challenges with meaningful applications. At the moment, I don’t
  have a single “forever” field nailed down yet, but I know I want to keep building
  my skills and experience in AI and HPC while applying them to problems that have
  a clear, practical impact.
