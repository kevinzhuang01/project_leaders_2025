abstract: Our BES funded software center NPNEQ intends to develop the methods and
  software to simulate time evolution of coupled electron-ion dynamics beyond perturbative
  approach, which is crucial for describing quantum nature of nonequilibrium dynamics.
desired: High level programing languages such as C++, Fortran, python as well as being
  familiar with parallelization methods such as MPI.
