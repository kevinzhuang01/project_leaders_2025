department: Statistics and Probability
status: Accept (Confirmed)
academic_interests: My academic research interests focus on integrating advanced analytical
  methods from computer and data science with my creative background in the arts—particularly
  dance—to drive innovation in sports analytics. I am passionate about leveraging
  artificial intelligence to analyze and classify human movement, with the vision
  of enhancing performance technology in sports and eventually applying these advancements
  to dance. Currently, I am working with a sport science professor and a Ph.D. student
  on a project with Michigan State University's volleyball team, where we use accelerometer
  data and techniques such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Support Vector Machines
  (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and XGBoost to classify player movements
  with a 95% accuracy rate. For my capstone, I plan to extend this work by developing
  a dance-specific classification model, combining movement science and machine learning
  to explore new applications in the performing arts.
