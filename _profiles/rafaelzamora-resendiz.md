abstract: Graph convolution and self-attention deep learning models have grown in
  popularity in the domain of proteomics. These machine learning approaches have been
  used in several proteomic problems including protein classification and protein-ligand
  binding affinity prediction. Searching for ligands and poses with high binding affinity
  have immediate applications in drug design and drug repurposing. While many DL tools
  have been used to model the site interaction at the residue level, atom-level models
  would effectively increase the resolution of interactions. Even so, scaling to systems
  with &gt;1,000 atoms is a non-trivial task which requires HPC. Recently, much work
  has gone into scaling training of language model architecture like GPT and BERT
  using HPC. The proposed project will explore utilizing language model architectures
  to scale the modeling of protein structures in the context of protein-ligand binding.
  Model parallelism will be used to enable modeling of proteins at the atomic level.
  After training on large datasets of binding site interactions, these models will
  be tested against out-of-training examples to observe its utility in imputing binding
  affinities across diverse protein and ligand databases. Methods for interpreting
  model parameters will be developed to provide biological meaningful insights that
  can help in drug design and repurposing.
