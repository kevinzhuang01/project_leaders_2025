abstract: Critical infrastructure networks—such as power grids, water distribution
  systems, and natural gas pipelines—form the backbone of modern society. Planning
  their design, daily operation, and expansion requires repeatedly solving large-scale,
  complex optimization problems. These problems are computationally challenging due
  to nonlinear and nonconvex flow models, discrete decision variables, and the vast
  scale of network systems. This project focuses on developing scalable optimization
  algorithms for such critical infrastructure systems. We leverage techniques such
  as linear relaxations, spatial and temporal decomposition, and problem-structure
  exploitation to design methods capable of handling realistic, high-fidelity flow
  models efficiently. The outcomes aim to enable faster and more reliable decision-making
  in infrastructure planning and operation—directly supporting the Department of Energy’s
  mission to enhance the resilience, efficiency, and security of national energy and
  water networks.
desired_skills: Interest in optimization algorithms, energy or network systems, or
  applied mathematics; experience with Julia, Python, C++, or MATLAB.
