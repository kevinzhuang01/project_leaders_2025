abstract: Multilevel methods are a class of algorithms which accelerate solutions
  of large problems by solving a sequence of smaller problems. Recent developments
  have shown multilevel methods may be used to train large neural networks by instead
  training a sequence of smaller networks. The benefits of these approaches are derived
  from the comparatively lower costs of training smaller networks. This is particularly
  effective for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which are a type of neural network
  which learn individual activation functions. This also allows for development of
  mathematical theory related to polynomial approximation of functions. These theories
  and algorithms may be used to accelerate training of neural networks for a variety
  of different applications, such as material modeling engineering applications.
