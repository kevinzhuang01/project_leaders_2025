biography: 'Roel Van Beeumen is a Staff Scientist in the Applied Mathematics and Computational
  Research Division at Berkeley Lab. His research interests range from numerical linear
  algebra and software for solving large-scale and high dimensional eigenvalue problems
  to quantum computing and quantum algorithms. He earned his PhD in Engineering Science:
  Computer Science (2015) at KU Leuven in Belgium, from which he also holds Master
  degrees in Mathematical Engineering (2010) and in Archaeology (2011).'

abstract: Current and near-term quantum computers, also known as noisy intermediate-scale
  quantum (NISQ) computers, are characterized by low qubit counts, short qubit decoherence
  times, and high gate error rates. On the other hand, rapid progress in both quantum
  hardware and software results in continuous simulation needs of novel/modified quantum
  algorithms. The QCLAB and QCLAB++ simulation software packages, developed at LBNL,
  are respectively an object-oriented MATLAB toolbox and a fully templated C++ package
  for constructing, representing, and simulating quantum circuits. Designed with an
  emphasis on numerical stability, efficiency, and performance, QCLAB provides a reliable
  platform for prototyping and testing quantum algorithms. For advanced performance
  needs, QCLAB++ serves as a complementary C++ package optimized for GPU-accelerated
  quantum circuit simulations. Together, QCLAB and QCLAB++ form a comprehensive toolkit,
  balancing the simplicity of MATLAB scripting with the computational power of GPU
  acceleration. Project ideas could include improving (CPU/GPU) performance, adding
  different noise models, implementing qudits functionalities, and expanding the quantum
  algorithms' base.
