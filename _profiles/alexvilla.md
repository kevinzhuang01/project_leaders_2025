academic_interests: My research interests encompass high-performance and parallel
  computing with applications to deep learning and scientific computing. I focus on
  optimizing collective communication protocols (MPI, NCCL), tensor computation for
  neural operators; alternatives to data parallelism and their performance analysis;
  and the design of scalable parallel frameworks for scientific applications. A particular
  area of my work is developing mathematically principled collective communication
  schemes to support scalable neural operators and machine-learning workloads. I primarily
  center my research focus in computer science, but I an inspired by problems that
  arise in computational science. I aim to leverage computing in mathematics and physics,
  and to build software that makes cross-disciplinary research faster, more reliable,
  and reproducible.
