abstract: Rising suicide rates in the U.S. remain a critical public health issue,
  especially when viewed alongside social determinants of health (SDOH) such as income,
  education, and access to care. This project introduces an interactive web map built
  with Python to explore these relationships at the county level over a 20-year period.
  The platform allows users to dynamically filter, explore, and overlay suicide data
  with key demographic indicators to identify high-risk regions. This poster highlights
  how accessible, web-based GIS tools can help researchers, policymakers, and communities
  better understand spatial health disparities and support data-driven, equity-focused
  public health strategies.
academic_interests: My academic and research interests center on the intersection
  of geospatial science, climate change, and public health. I am particularly interested
  in how environmental factors and policy decisions affect vulnerable communities,
  and how GIS and data science can be used to analyze and visualize these impacts.
  My goal is to use spatial data to inform solutions for real-world problems such
  as wildfire risk, environmental contamination, and health disparities. My interest
  in this area began through my coursework in geography and deepened during my internship
  at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where I created interactive maps using
  Python to explore correlations between suicide rates and social determinants of
  health. This project taught me the value of computational tools in identifying patterns
  that might otherwise go unnoticed, reinforcing my desire to pursue interdisciplinary
  research that combines public health and environmental science. I am also driven
  by personal experience. Living in Southern California, I’ve witnessed wildfires
  near my own neighborhood, which has motivated me to use GIS and remote sensing to
  study fire risk and mitigation strategies. In a recent academic project, I analyzed
  fire hazard zones in Riverside, California, using spatial overlay and geoprocessing
  techniques such as clipping, dissolving, and spatial joins. Through future research,
  I hope to bridge the gap between environmental science and public health using geospatial
  technologies, and contribute to more resilient, informed, and equitable communities.
