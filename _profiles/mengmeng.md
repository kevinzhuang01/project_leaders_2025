name: Meng Meng

  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); High-Performance Computing
status: Accept
abstract: My expertise covers advanced multi-physics geomechanics testing, well integrity,
  cement materials, poromechanical modeling, and data analysis. With these skills,
  I have participated in many different projects, including well integrity and stability
  for geothermal and CCUS, wellbore and reservoir stimulation for geothermal and unconventional,
  injection induced seismicity for geothermal and carbon sequestration, and data analysis
  for CCUS. I believe there are still lots of opportunities for Petroleum Engineering
  with application to the energy transition.
desired: I hope to work with students with rock mechanics, petroleum, civil, mathematics,
  and mining background. If the students are interested in geothermal and carbon sequestration,
  we can find more topics to work on.
