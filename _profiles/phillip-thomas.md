biography: Phillip is an Application Performance Engineer at NERSC. His areas of expertise
  include Fortran, GPU programming, and algorithms related to tackling the Curse of
  Dimensionality. His efforts at NERSC involve improving the performance of material
  science applications. Before coming to NERSC, Phillip developed compute kernels
  for Wave Computing in Santa Clara, California. Prior to that Phillip worked as a
  post-doctoral researcher in quantum reaction dynamics at Queen's University in Ontario,
  Canada and at Leiden University in the Netherlands. He also has experience in experimental
  molecular spectroscopy from a post-doctoral fellowship at The Ohio State University.
  Phillip's Ph.D. thesis topic was spectroscopy and simulation of reactive organic
  molecules.

abstract: Our group is interested in simulating infrared spectra of molecules from
  first principles calculations. We have a code, called "MLCP", which solves the high-dimensional
  eigenvalue problem to generate the energy levels. We are interested in building
  an automated simulation pipeline which integrates MLCP with other tools to rapidly
  simulate vibrational spectra of new systems.
