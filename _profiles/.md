project_title: Searching Stable Chemical Space through Computational Methods using
  Multi-objectives Genetic Algorithm
motivation: I am interested in attending the US-RSE25 conference Building Engagement
  program because it directly aligns with both my career goals as a computational
  scientist and my passion for research software engineering (RSE). My academic journey
  from mathematics to computational science has shown me how critical high-quality,
  sustainable software is for advancing research. Through building molecular dynamics
  simulations, implementing genetic algorithms, and now developing multi-objective
  optimization workflows with Phonopy and PyGAD on NERSC JupyterHub, I have experienced
  firsthand the impact of well-designed software pipelines on accelerating discovery.
  The Building Engagement program offers a unique opportunity to connect with the
  wider RSE community, exchange ideas with peers who are also bridging science and
  software and learn from leaders who are shaping best practices in reproducibility,
  scalability, and community-driven software. Attending US-RSE25 will help me refine
  my own approach to sustainable research software while contributing my perspective
  as someone integrating optimization, phonon analysis, and machine learning potentials
  into computational materials science. Ultimately, this experience will strengthen
  my ability to contribute to open-source frameworks, mentor future scientists, and
  build bridges between computational research and the communities it serves.
