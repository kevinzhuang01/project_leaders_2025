academic_interests: For my senior capstone project, I was able to design a PCB board
  where I had to determine which components would best be of use for my board's purpose;
  hydrophone signal acquisition. Classes that assisted in this project was my embedded
  systems course. From this, I realized I enjoyed finding in-depth purposes of each
  component. I would like to study either how to making components more efficient
  and more sustainable. In my research affiliate position at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
  I was able to research source codes and software packages that ultimately helped
  my mentor and I achieve the sustainability and ultimately saving time and nodes
  used in the supercomputer, the Perlmutter, to efficiently retrieve data. From this
  I am interested in learning more on how to optimize a system that is already intact
  to have better/less energy consumption.
