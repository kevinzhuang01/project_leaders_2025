status: Accept (Confirmed)
academic_interests: My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of
  computer science, applied mathematics, and environmental health. I am particularly
  interested in leveraging data analysis, visualization, and reproducible software
  to address challenges in environmental justice and public health research. Through
  my work with the San Diego State University Research Foundation, I collected and
  analyzed real-time air quality data and developed dashboards in R to communicate
  findings to stakeholders. This experience showed me how computational methods can
  directly impact communities by making complex data accessible for decision-making.
  Similarly, my involvement with Comite Cívico Del Valle allowed me to contribute
  to projects highlighting environmental hazards, reinforcing my commitment to using
  research as a tool for advocacy. I am also fascinated by emerging technologies that
  enhance the security, portability, and scalability of research software. My technical
  interests span data science, reproducibility, and containerization, as well as the
  application of AI to improve data-driven insights. Looking ahead, I hope to pursue
  research that integrates software engineering with environmental health initiatives,
  ensuring that tools are not only scientifically rigorous but also equitable and
  accessible. Ultimately, my academic interests are motivated by the belief that computational
  research can be a powerful driver for social good. I aim to continue bridging technical
  innovation with public service by building research software that amplifies voices
  from underrepresented communities and helps create healthier, more sustainable futures.

additional_comments: As a first-generation college student from a migrant background,
  I bring a perspective that emphasizes equity, accessibility, and representation
  in STEM. My goal is not only to grow as a research software engineer but also to
  help make computing and research more inclusive, particularly for communities that
  have historically been excluded from scientific decision-making. I am committed
  to bridging the gap between academic research and community impact by creating open,
  accessible, and secure software tools that support public health and environmental
  justice. I see the Building Engagement program as an opportunity to strengthen these
  skills, connect with mentors, and prepare to lead future projects that use research
  software for social good.
