project_title: Event-Driven GPU Memory Management for Efficient Sparse Training
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: Current GPU training systems waste significant compute and memory on zero
  activations in sparse neural networks. We propose an event-driven GPU architecture
  that triggers computation only for non-zero activations, achieving 3x memory efficiency
  and 2x training speedup on sparse workloads. Our system uses CUDA events to coordinate
  dynamic memory allocation and kernel dispatch based on runtime sparsity patterns.
  We evaluate transformer models with 70-90% sparsity, showing consistent improvements
  over PyTorch and other baselines while maintaining accuracy. This work demonstrates
  how event-driven computing can unlock GPU efficiency for the next generation of
  large, sparse neural networks.
academic_interests: As a PhD student in Computer Science, my research focuses on AI,
  machine learning, and their applications in scalable, real-world systems. I am particularly
  interested in physical AI, Interpretability, multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), reinforcement
  learning, and graph neural networks, and how these can be applied to decentralized
  coordination problems. My current work explores interpretable learning algorithms
  and hybrid neural-symbolic approaches that improve agent decision-making in constrained
  environments. I'm also deeply interested in LLM reliability, hallucination detection,
  and the role of structured data in enhancing the trustworthiness of retrieval-augmented
  generation systems.
