academic_interests: Curiosity about how data explains real-world patterns drives my
  academic path. One project I’m working on with my father studies Ethiopia’s import
  data. By building predictive models, we’re exploring how trade trends can be understood
  and even forecasted, which connects my love of computer science with broader global
  challenges. I am currently working with the Better Business Bureau on a computer
  science program focused on business data. This role involves matching and cleaning
  records from different sources, which has shown me how important accuracy and trust
  are in data systems. It has also strengthened my interest in creating reliable tools
  that organizations can depend on. Building side projects is another way I explore
  ideas. “Party Jam,” an app that lets groups upvote songs to play, grew from my passion
  for both music and technology. I’m also developing a chatbot for Marriott’s FOSSE
  system, which uses natural language processing to make training resources easier
  to access. Moving forward, my goal is to keep blending computer science, data analysis,
  and AI to design tools that are practical, accessible, and meaningful for everyday
  users as well as for larger communities.
