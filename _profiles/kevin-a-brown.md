biography: Kevin A. Brown is the Assistant Computer Scientist at Argonne National
  Laboratory where he investigates new designs for supercomputer networks. He received
  his B.Sc. from the University of Technology, Jamaica (UTech) and his M.Sc. and Ph.D.
  in Mathematical and Computing Science from the Tokyo Institute of Technology. His
  prior work experience includes serving as a Unix Systems Administrator at Digicel
  (Jamaica) Ltd. and as a postdoctoral appointee in the Argonne Leadership Computing
  Facility focused on exascale interconnect performance evaluation.

abstract: 'Large-scale computing infrastructure—including supercomputers and wide-area
  research networks—underpins breakthroughs in science and engineering. Yet the scale
  and complexity of these systems make them difficult to deploy, operate, and optimize.
  They produce massive volumes of telemetry and logs that must be distilled into actionable
  insight, and faults can cascade across subsystems, degrading reliability and productivity
  if not detected and mitigated quickly. Our work brings together complementary capabilities
  to study, design, and optimize these infrastructures: • System and workload modeling
  that combines AI, parallel discrete-event simulation (PDES), and fast surrogate
  models • Scalable log and telemetry analysis, including automated, AI-assisted pipelines
  • Anomaly detection and failure prediction to improve resilience • Network performance
  benchmarking, measurement, and analysis to guide planning and operations'
