biography: Navamita Ray is a staff scientist in the co-design team in CCS-7 with expertise
  in meshing and numerical methods. She has worked on developing various mesh-based
  algorithms such as surface reconstruction, optimization and adaptivity targeted
  towards high-order numerical methods as well as designing unstructured mesh data
  structures for parallel computing. At LANL, she has worked on developing software
  libraries for upcoming exascale machines such as the runtime library FleCSI and
  mesh-to-mesh data remapping library, Portage, to perform inline remapping and link
  LANL application codes. She is involved in developing meshing capabilities in the
  Crosslink library, which is LANL’s in-house mesh generation code as well as exploring
  machine learning for mesh generation problems.
project_title: Automatic Shape Matching for Complex 3D CAD Models
topical_areas: Applied Computer Science; Applied Mathematics; Artificial Intelligence
  and Intelligent Systems
abstract: Automatic hexahedral mesh generation for general 3D shapes is an open problem.
  This internship will explore machine learning methods for automating shape recognition
  within complex models that would aid in mesh generation via application of domain
  knowledge specific templates.
desired_skills: Software skills such as familiarity with using unix commands, copying
  files to and fro from remote systems, etc. Programming skills such as a basic knowledge
  of compiled (C/C++) and interpreted languages (python). ML skills such as basic
  knowledge of supervised learning and other standard ML approaches.
