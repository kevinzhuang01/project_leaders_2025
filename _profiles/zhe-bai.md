biography: Zhe Bai is a computational science researcher in the Applied Mathematics
  and Computational Research Division of the Computing Sciences Area at Lawrence Berkeley
  National Laboratory. Her research interests lie in the area of data-driven modeling
  and model order reduction, including dynamic mode decomposition, scientific machine
  learning and sparse algorithms for large-scale computation and simulation. Cultivated
  interdisciplinary research and collaborations spanning the fields of computational
  science and engineering, her work focuses on AI-based modeling that couples first-principles
  with data-driven approaches to understand, estimate and control high-dimensional
  physical systems.
project_title: Sequential modeling of multi-scale dynamical systems
topical_areas: Applied Computer Science; Applied Mathematics; Artificial Intelligence
  and Intelligent Systems; High Performance Computing
abstract: This project develops advanced sequential models to analyze time-series
  data. The goal is to capture the complex, multi-scale, path-dependent relationships
  using historic event data. The model is expected to learn both short-term and long-term
  temporal patterns for an overall reliable forecast.
desired_skills: Proficient in coding; experienced in optimizing neural networks; interested
  in transformers and/or high performance computing.
