biography: Wozniak designs and implements workflow systems for scientific applications
  and deep learning workloads, combining techniques from high-performance computing
  and distributed computing. He has extensive experience integrating advanced computing
  techniques in collaboration with the health, experimental, and simulation sciences.
project_title: Applying Performance Prediction to Live Filesystems
topical_areas: Applied Computer Science; Applied Mathematics; Artificial Intelligence
  and Intelligent Systems; Open Source Software; Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking;
  Visualization and Human-Computer Systems
abstract: Large shared filesystems can be an unpredictable environment for running
  large scientific workflows. Our team has developed a performance collection and
  prediction software package. We would now like to improve the software, make it
  more portable and easy to use, and run it on more real-world filesystems. The team
  in this project will run the data collection and prediction tools on live systems
  with real applications. The research aspect will be in how to interpret and visualize
  the resulting data. Possible applications include light source experiments from
  the Advanced Photon Source and data management workflows from epidemics modeling.
