biography: Bert de Jong is the Director of the Quantum Systems Accelerator, which
  is part of the National Quantum Initiative. In addition, de Jong is the Team Director
  of the Accelerated Research for Quantum Computing (ARQC) Team MACH-Q, funded by
  DOE ASCR, focused on developing software stacks for near-term quantum computing
  devices. In addition, de Jong has a program in AI and machine learning to understand
  biomolecular processes, and discover new materials and molecular crystals for gas
  adsorption. de Jong serves as the Department Head for Computational Sciences, and
  leads the Applied Computing for Scientific Discovery Group, which advances scientific
  computing by developing and enhancing applications in key disciplines, as well as
  developing HPC, quantum and AI tools and libraries for addressing general problems
  in computational science.
project_title: AI agents for chemical and materials science
topical_areas: Chemical Engineering; Computer Science; Condensed Matter Physics
abstract: Discovering new materials or chemical processes is a complex and time-consuming
  endeavor, often requiring countless experiments, intricate analysis, and sometimes
  even serendipitous discoveries. Inverse design has the promise to rationally discover
  new materials and processes. Supported by artificial intelligence, inverse design
  can dramatically accelerate this process by analyzing vast datasets, predicting
  material properties, and guiding experimental design—reducing both the time and
  uncertainty involved in scientific discovery. Our team is working on developing
  agents, integrated with machine learning and large language models, self-driving
  experiments and HPC simulations.
desired_skills: Physical chemistry or materials knowledge would be helpful Good understanding
  of AI and ML methods, some knowledge of agentic AI.
