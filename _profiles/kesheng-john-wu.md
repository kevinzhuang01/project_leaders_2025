biography: Dr. Kesheng (John) Wu leads multiple R&D endeavors focused on advanced
  technologies and testbeds at the Scientific Networking Division of Lawrence Berkeley
  National Laboratory. These projects aim to expedite data transfer among DOE user
  facilities, implement in-network storage and computational resources for intricate
  scientific workflows, and explore algorithms, strategies, and practices to enhance
  the efficiency of network operations. Additionally, Dr. Wu's team is tasked with
  developing and managing networking testbeds, providing the broader research community
  with platforms to explore future generations of networking technologies and optimize
  their utilization. These testbeds encompass conventional optical networking alongside
  cutting-edge quantum communication capabilities.
project_title: Advanced Modeling for Prediction and Anomaly Detection in Network Operations
topical_areas: Applied Computer Science; Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems;
  Infrastructure and Instrumentation
abstract: 'As we approach the summer of 2026, our goal is to develop and deploy advanced
  modeling capabilities for predicting hardware failures and detecting external configuration
  anomalies in our network infrastructure. This project aims to leverage machine learning
  and data analytics to improve network stability, reduce unplanned outages, and enhance
  overall network efficiency. We will focus on two key areas: (1) Predicting Hardware
  Failures: By analyzing log and telemetry data, we will develop models to predict
  hardware failures in networking equipment, enabling proactive replacement and minimizing
  downtime. (2) Detecting Network Configuration Anomalies: We will create a tool to
  analyze received network configuration data, identify routing path changes, and
  notify engineers of anomalies, ensuring swift response to potential disruptions.
  Through this project, we will apply advanced modeling techniques to drive business
  outcomes, including: - Improved network stability and reduced unplanned outages
  - Enhanced predictive capabilities for hardware failures and configuration anomalies
  - Data-driven decision-making for network operations and maintenance By investing
  in advanced modeling and analytics, we will take a proactive approach to network
  operations, ensuring a more resilient and efficient network infrastructure for the
  summer of 2026 and beyond.'
