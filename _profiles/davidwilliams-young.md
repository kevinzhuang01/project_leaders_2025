abstract: In this research, we will develop novel methods for the efficient solution
  of the quantum many-body problem by leveraging the latest advances in modern high-performance
  computing and sparse numerical linear algebra. Key applications of this work will
  be accelerating scientific simulations in computational chemistry, nuclear physics,
  high-energy physics and quantum information science, each of which hold significant
  potential to advance our understanding of the universe and the fundamental physical
  laws that govern it. Researchers will gain hands-on experience in these and related
  fields and work in a highly-collaborative environment, on-site at Lawrence Berkeley
  National Lab.
desired: Programming experience and a background in quantum mechanics, computational
  physics and/or linear algebra are highly desirable, but not required. Experience
  programing GPUs and working with distributed computing (MPI) would increase the
  scope of potential projects.
