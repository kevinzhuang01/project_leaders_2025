academic_interests: My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of
  cybersecurity, software engineering, and machine learning —three fields that are
  continually evolving and reshaping society. What first drew me to them is their
  constant change. Each new advancement or challenge creates opportunities to solve
  pressing problems. Cybersecurity, for example, is never static; as technology advances,
  so do the threats, requiring new strategies to protect sensitive data and secure
  networks. Software engineering, meanwhile, is the backbone of innovation, driving
  the development of systems and applications that directly influence how people live
  and work. I have seen this firsthand through my own projects, from building network
  tools to designing interactive web applications, where the challenge lies in creating
  solutions that are both efficient and accessible. Machine learning adds another
  layer of transformation, offering predictive and adaptive capabilities that can
  improve everything from intrusion detection to software development practices. Together,
  these fields push technology forward while presenting constant challenges to be
  solved. It is this dynamic nature, balance of problem-solving, innovation, and societal
  impact, that inspires me to continue exploring their intersections.
