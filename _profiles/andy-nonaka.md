biography: Andy Nonaka is a Staff Scientist and Group Lead of the Center for Computational
  Sciences and Engineering at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. His research
  interests include high-performance implementations of multiphysics and multiscale
  algorithms for partial differential equations, with a recent emphasis on electrodynamical,
  fluid dynamical, and material science applications. More generally, he is interested
  in adaptive structured mesh algorithms, particle and particle/mesh methods, linear
  solvers, and machine learning techniques to accelerate scientific discovery.

  and Benchmarking; Software Engineering
abstract: The Center for Computational Sciences and Engineering (CCSE) at LBNL is
  a high-performance modeling and simulation group interested in applications described
  by complex partial differential equations including fluids (industrial, biological,
  and micro/nanoscale), plasma physics, microelectronics, and environmental flows.
  The underlying software framework we develop and use is called AMReX, a GPU/exascale-enabled
  block-structured adaptive mesh refinement software framework that also includes
  particle/mesh, embedded boundary, and linear solver capabilities. We also develop
  data-driven / machine-learning enhancement, and code coupling strategies to both
  accelerate and increase the fidelity of our codes. We are looking for collaborators
  with common interests in the computer science, applied mathematics, and/or application
  science aspects of research performed within CCSE.
desired_skills: C++, python, numerical methods, partial differential equations, domain
  knowledge in fluids, plasmas, microelectronics, and/or environmental flow.
